        description: "In collaboration with the California Strawberry Commission, my capstone team and I developed a platform to enhance strawberry production through remote operation of strawberry harvesters and analysis of the farm’s data. I served as the Front End Technical Lead on the project, with my primary focus being helping my teammates use ReactJS and AWS."

        description: "I’m individually developing a platform that would allow climbing gyms to more effectively manage their local climbing competitions — more specifically by improving registration and automated scoring.  After conducting interviews with several climbing gym managers, I learned that gyms lack a common interface to input competition data, and that it can take hours to score just one competition.  My solution is to create a unified experience where gyms can manage participants, set up the competition, and total the scorecards with TensorFlow."

        time: "2018",
        technologies: ["TensorFlow", "Python"],
        description: "Built using TensorFlow, the Strawberry Object Detection project is a machine learning model that aims to alleviate stress due to labor shortages in the strawberry harvesting industry.  A key goal of this industry is fully autonomous strawberry picking, making strawberry identification an integral concern.  Utilizing transfer learning, we were able to greatly reduce the size of our training set while increasing performance."
